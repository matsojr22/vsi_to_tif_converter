vsi_to_tif_converter
====================

/The following macro code was written by Matthew Jacobs in the Salk Institute's Callaway Neuroscience Lab. 
//It is designed to help convert Olympus Slide Scanner .vsi files into .tif files which can be opened in third party software. 
//This code does not keep 100% of the detail stored in the .vsi, but does give access to the detail scan information in the tif format. 
//There are continuing issues with the autoscaling of the fluorescent chanels, but each channel of the image can be manually scaled after conversion as desired.
